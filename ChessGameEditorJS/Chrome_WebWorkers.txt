Due to Chromeâ€™s security restrictions, Web Workers will not run locally
(e.g., from file://). Instead, they fail silently! To run your app using 
local files and the file:// scheme, run Chrome with the 

    --allow-file-access-from-files 
    
flag set. It is not recommended to run your regular browser with this flag set. 
It should only be used for testing or development purposes.
